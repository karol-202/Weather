# Weather
System for controlling a weather station based on Arduino.
It contains two apps: one for Arduino, which the station is based on and second for PC.

The Arduino app collects weather data every 30 minutes and stores it in memory. Program can communicate with PC for example for downloading the data from Arduino or sending current date. The application can also control LCD displaying current weather data, like temperature, humidity and rain level.

The PC app collects the weather data from Arduino and shows it in form of graph. It also takes the forecast data and compare it to measured weather.
